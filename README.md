# US_State_Game
This is a very simple python program, used Python, Pandas and Turtle for it. *beginner project*
<h1>US-STATE-GAME</h1>
<p>This is one of the very first Python programmes I have written, and this is also one of my favourite beginner's programmes.</p>
<br>
<h1>How to run it?</h1>
<p>1. Fork and Pull the project in your local machine</p>
<p>2. Setup virtual environment, I prefer PyCharm for this process.</p>
