<h1>US-STATE-GAME</h1>
<p>This is one of the very first Python programmes I have written, and this is also one of my favourite beginner's programmes.</p>
<br>
<h1>How to run it?</h1>
<p>1. Fork and Pull the project on your local machine</p>
<p>2. Check Interpreter and Virtual Environment. Personally, I prefer PyCharm as my Python IDE.</p>
<p>3. Install dependencies. For this small project we only have to install Pandas.</p>
<br>
<h1>What is this game about?</h1>
<p>So when you run the program, a turtle window will open with a map of the USA. In an input bar, you will be asked to guess the states of the USA. If your answer is correct, the empty map will be filled with the name of the corresponding state. </p>
